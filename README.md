# python-challenge

PyBank I felt it was very straight forward I completed it without a hassle, I know is possible to make the code under one reader but my code wasn't running without one so I added an other one and it magically worked.

PyPoll I used tutoring to get a better hang on getting the name winner, and getting it to appear as a list with name, percent, total vote per candidate

I used AI for clear layout, and get my code to commit into my depositary with all the help of AskBCS to use different commands
